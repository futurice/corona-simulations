The true hospitalization rate in Epidemic Calculator is actually the displayed hospitalization rate plus infected fatality rate (which is labelled 'case fatality rate'). In other words, the parameter value was mislabeled. We could have resolved this in a few different ways. For example, we could have simply labelled the parameter value correctly ('hospitalization rate, excluding people who eventually die'). That would have been awkward for end users. Instead, we chose to to keep the parameter label simple ('Hospitalization rate') and make the displayed value conform to that description. So the value displayed to end users is hospitalization_rate_excluding_fatalities + fatality_rate. You can verify this by moving the fatality rate slider; you will notice that the hospitalization rate changes as well.",

This is equivalent to assuming that the 'ICU track' is an alternative track to 'regular ward track' and assuming that the length of ICU hospitalization is equivalent to length of regular ward hospitalization. In reality, ICU patients will typically visit the regular ward first, and the duration of their hospitalization will be longer than the duration of regular ward patients' hospitalization.",
